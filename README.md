This test demonstrates two different ways of importing a function, and the effect
on the bundle of each way.

Setup steps:
1. npm install (tested on Node v6.10.2)

Open main.js (the bundle entry point) to see what's going on.

To build the bundle from the root directory:
./node_modules/.bin/webpack

Open ./dist/index.html in Chrome to view the bundle contents.
